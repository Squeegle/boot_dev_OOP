    "One of the greatest sins when trying to write \"clean code\" is using misleading variable and function names. Take a look at the destroy_wall function. It takes a list of numbers as input (each representing the health of a wall) and returns a new list with each entry of 0 or less removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on its name, you might assume that destroy_wall destroys a single wall, but if you look closely, you'll see that it handles multiple walls.\n",

    "    The test suite expects a different function name. Take a look at the main_test.py file to see what it's looking for, and rename the function accordingly.\n",
